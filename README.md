# Pennylane Projects

These projects are written from Pennylane :


- A simple circuit on the rotation of a qubit and an __optimization__ of the angles of rotation

- An implementation of a noisy circuit focusing on __*Kraus Matrices*__

The using of Pennylane has sound interesting to me because of the great functionnalities we can do with optimization. I have also found the tutorials quite attractive in a mathematical way, especially the tutorial on Kraus Matrices.
